# 5G Network Modeling Workshop



This repo contains the files required to run the hands-on 5G network modeling workshop in MATLAB®. The "Exercise" files require code additions to  
run.  The "Solution Scripts" files have the required code additions and run  
to completion.

The files enable the following exercises:

1. Exercise 1 - Operate the simulation engine, configure 5G nodes, create a simple network, and see statistics
2. Exercise 2 - Plug a custom downlink channel into the simulated 5G network   
3. Exercise 3 - 5G Intercell Interference Modeling
4. Exercise 4 - Plug a custom scheduler into the 5G network model


## Setup

To Run:

1. To conduct the workshop, use the "Exercise" files
2. To simply run the completed exercises, run the following files in MATLAB:

* EX1\_NR\_Simplest\_Network\_Soln.mlx
* EX2\_NR\_Custom\_Channel\_Soln.mlx
* EX3\_NR\_Interference\_Modeling\_Soln.mlx
* EX4\_NR\_Custom\_Scheduler\_Soln.mlx
